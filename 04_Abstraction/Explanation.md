## üí° What is Abstraction?

Abstraction means showing only the important things and hiding the rest. It focuses on exposing only the essential details and hiding the complex details.

### Real-life Example:
Imagine you‚Äôre driving a car. When you drive, you don‚Äôt need to understand the technical workings inside the engine (like spark plugs, carburetors, engine oil, etc.). You only need to interact with the following essential parts:

- Steering
- Accelerator
- Brake
- Gear
- Clutch

You don‚Äôt need to know how the engine works or how all the parts connect. You only need to know the parts that help you drive the car. This is an example of **abstraction** ‚Äî the internal workings of the car are hidden, and only the necessary controls are exposed for you to use.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Abstraction in Java:

1. **Abstract Class:**
   An abstract class is a class that defines some common functionality, but leaves some methods undefined. This class is incomplete and is used as a blueprint for subclasses. The subclasses are required to implement the missing methods to complete the functionality.

2. **Interface:**
   An interface is like a contract that specifies which methods will be present in a class, but it leaves the implementation of those methods to the subclasses. The interface ensures that the methods are defined, but doesn't provide the method details, which must be filled in by the implementing class.

## ‚ú® Benefits of Abstraction:

### 1. Hiding Complexity:
Abstraction allows you to hide complex details. For example, the engine of the car is abstracted for you. You don‚Äôt need to worry about how it works, just how to drive the car.

### 2. Modular Design:
Using abstraction, we can make our code more modular. Each class encapsulates its own functionality, making the code easier to manage and more organized.

### 3. Maintainability:
When you abstract the detailed implementation, it becomes easier to maintain and modify your code. You only need to make changes in the abstracted parts, which reduces the complexity of maintenance.

### 4. Flexibility:
If you need to change the implementation, you can easily modify the abstract class or interface without affecting the rest of the code. This flexibility allows you to adapt to new requirements without altering the entire system.
