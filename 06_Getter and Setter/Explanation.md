## 📦 What are Getters and Setters?

### 🔐 Rule of Encapsulation:
When you declare variables as **private** (so they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class), you use **getters and setters** to access and modify these variables from outside.

### 🧠 Getter:
A **getter** is used to **read the value** of a private variable.

- It is a **public method** that **returns the value** of a private variable.
- Helps in **accessing private data** in a controlled and secure way.

---

### 🛠️ Setter:

A **setter** is used to **set or update** the value of a private variable.

- It is also a **public method** that **modifies the value** of a private variable.
- Setters allow controlled modification of data from outside the class.
