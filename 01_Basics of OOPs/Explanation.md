#  Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** is a programming style that models real-life entities as **objects** in software. It helps us organize code into **classes** and **objects**, making code more **manageable**, **scalable**, and **maintainable**.

---

##  What is OOPs?

OOPs is a technique where real-world entities like `Car`, `BankAccount`, or `Student` are represented as objects.

Each **object** contains:
- **Attributes (Data)** – The properties of the object
- **Methods (Behaviors)** – The actions the object can perform

This approach helps us write code that mirrors the **real world**, making it more intuitive and modular.

---

##  Four Pillars of OOPs in Java

OOPs is built upon **four fundamental principles** that guide how we structure and use our classes and objects:

---

### 1️⃣ Encapsulation

Encapsulation means **wrapping data (attributes)** and **code (methods)** together into a **single unit** – a class.

- It hides internal implementation details from outside users.
- Only exposes **what’s necessary** using **getters and setters**.
- Helps in **data security** and **code organization**.

 Think of a **capsule** – you can see the outer cover but not the ingredients inside.

---

### 2️⃣ Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class (child class) to **inherit properties and methods** from another class (parent class).

- Promotes **code reusability**
- Helps in building a **hierarchy of classes**
- Enables us to create specialized classes based on general ones

 Like a **child inheriting traits** from parents.

---

### 3️⃣ Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "**many forms**". It allows the **same method name** to behave **differently** based on the context.

- Achieved using **method overloading** and **method overriding**
- Increases **code flexibility** and **readability**

 Like a person playing different roles in different situations.

---

### 4️⃣ Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of **hiding complex implementation** and showing only **essential features** to the user.

- Focuses on **what an object does**, not **how it does it**
- Achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**

 Like a **TV remote** – you press a button, but don’t know the inner workings.

---

##  Advantages of OOPs

###  1. Code Reusability

- Use **Inheritance** to reuse fields and methods from existing classes.
- Avoid writing duplicate code.

---

###  2. Easy to Manage & Modify

- Code is organized into objects, making it easier to **locate and update** specific features.

---

###  3. Data Hiding (Encapsulation)

- Internal data is kept **private**
- Can only be accessed or modified via **public methods**

---

###  4. Real-World Modeling

- You can represent real-world things like `Car`, `Employee`, `BankAccount` using Java classes.
- Makes the software **easier to understand** and **relatable**.

---

###  5. Polymorphism = Flexibility

- Same method name can be used for **different tasks**
- Makes code **cleaner**, more **dynamic**, and **maintainable**

---

###  6. Scalability

- Easier to **add new features** or modules without affecting existing code.
- Useful for building **large applications**.

---

##  Conclusion

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** is a powerful design approach in Java that helps write structured, reusable, and scalable code by modeling real-world problems using classes and objects. By following the **four pillars** – **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction** – we can build robust, secure, and maintainable applications.
