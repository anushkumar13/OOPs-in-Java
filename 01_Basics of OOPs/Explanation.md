# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** is a programming style that models real-life entities as objects in the software. It allows us to organize code into classes and objects, making it easier to manage, scale, and maintain.

## What is OOPs?

OOPs is a technique where real-world entities (like a car, bank account, or employee) are modeled as objects in the system. Each object has:

- **Attributes (Data)**: The properties or characteristics of the object.
- **Methods (Behaviors)**: The functions or actions that the object can perform.

This helps in writing code that is intuitive and mirrors the real world.

## Four Pillars of OOPs

OOPs is built on four main principles:

### 1. **Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a **class**. This helps in hiding the internal details and exposing only the necessary parts.

### 2. **Inheritance**
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, making code more reusable and easier to maintain.

### 3. **Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows one method to behave in different ways based on the object that invokes it, providing flexibility in code.

### 4. **Abstraction**
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features to the user.

## Advantages of OOPs

1. **Code Reusability**  
   You can reuse code by creating classes that can be inherited, reducing redundancy and maintaining consistency.

2. **Easy to Manage & Modify**  
   Code is well-organized into objects, so it is easier to manage and modify specific parts of the application.

3. **Data Hiding**  
   OOPs ensures that an object's internal data is private and can only be accessed or modified through its methods, providing better security.

4. **Real-World Modeling**  
   OOPs helps model real-world entities (like students, employees, cars) in the system, making it easier to understand and relate to the application.

5. **Polymorphism = Flexibility**  
   Polymorphism allows you to use the same method name for different behaviors, making your code cleaner and more flexible.

6. **Scalability**  
   OOPs makes it easy to scale applications by adding new features without affecting existing code.
